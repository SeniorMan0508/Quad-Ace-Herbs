# 🌿 Quad-Ace Herbs — Shop & Admin Dashboard Guide

We have created a dedicated **Shop Page** for your customers to browse all remedies, plus a secure **Admin Dashboard** and a **Node.js Backend Server** for the owner to manage products, update passwords, and recover access safely!

---

## 🚀 How to Start the Website & Backend

Run the following command in your project terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This launches the server at **`http://localhost:3000`**:
- **Home Page**: [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html)
- **Shop Catalog**: [http://localhost:3000/shop.html](http://localhost:3000/shop.html)
- **Admin Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000/admin.html](http://localhost:3000/admin.html)

---

## 🔒 1. Private Admin Portal & Password Security

The Admin Dashboard is **100% invisible to regular customers**:
- **No public links**: There are zero "Admin" links in the navigation or footer.
- **Secret Shortcut**: Press **`Ctrl + Shift + A`** on the keyboard while anywhere on the site to jump directly to the Admin login.
- **Initial Default Passcode**: `quadace2026`
- **Owner Registered Recovery Email**: `badmusdaniel0508@gmail.com`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Plaintext Passwords & No Visible Security Keys:**
> Passwords are encrypted on the server using cryptographic salted hashing (`scrypt`). No security keys or passcodes are exposed on screen or in code. Whenever a password reset is requested, a secure **one-time 6-digit verification code** is sent directly to the owner's email address.
